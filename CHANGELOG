v1.30
=====

* Upgrade burpui-agent to v0.6.1 https://github.com/CoffeeITWorks/ansible_burp2_server/issues/28

Now this role compiles with some better configurations for performance improvements, you can also change the variable `burp_configure_line` with your own configure flags too.
See https://github.com/CoffeeITWorks/ansible_burp2_server/issues/24.
* Add backup script tool from @deajan
backup_script_tool is added as optional installation, you can use var `install_backup_tool_script: true` to install, see defaults/main.yml vars for more options.

* Molecule tests for debian8, debian9, centos7, ubuntu latest, ubuntu trusty
* Improved check for new install, it will ensure certificates required for burp are created: 
  - name: supervisor | wait for burpca to get all server certificates
    wait_for:
      path: "{{ item }}"
      state: present
    with_items:
      - '/etc/burp/ssl_cert_ca-server.pem'
      - '/etc/burp/ssl_cert-server.key'
      - '/etc/burp/ssl_cert-server.pem'

v1.8
====

* Add notify failure by email
  Modify these variables in you host/group vars 
  to allow notification when a failure occurs
  burp_notify_failure: false

  burp_notify_failure_email_from: "burp_{{ ansible_nodename }}@domain.net"
