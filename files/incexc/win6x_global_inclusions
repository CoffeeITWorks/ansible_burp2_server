# Due to issue: https://github.com/grke/burp/issues/501
# I'm moving some inclusions and reducing the way I'm using nested files and also not including anything that is not 
# on all clients. 
# So this file is not used until we have fixed the issue with nested includes and server initiated restore with regex
